# knights-tour
A solution to the knights tour challenge, as well as an attempt to find the shortest path between two coordinates on a chessboard.


---------------------------------------------

As I said above, this code is fully functional in finding a solution to the knight's tour problem, in which a knight can go to every space on the chessboard without repeating, given a starting coordinate. I have attempted to reach the next level of this project and find the shortest path between two given coordinates. However, I have not been able to successfully solve this challenge and I can't find the logical error in my code. I would greatly appreciate any suggestions on how to improve or fix this project, especially on how to optimize it!

I would be happy to explain my logic to anyone looking to understand my thought process, as hopefully that will allow better revision of the code. I haven't commented my code yet, but I do plan to soon.
